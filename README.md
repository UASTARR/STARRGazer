  Offline Map Display Application (Flutter)

  This Flutter application displays an offline map using the `flutter_map` package
  and MBTiles data stored on the local file system. The map is enhanced with the 
  ability to load and display coordinates from a text file.

  Features:
  - Loads and displays MBTiles from a specified file path.
  - Reads GPS coordinates from a `.txt` file and plots them on the map.
  - Uses polylines to connect the plotted points.
  - Handles missing or unavailable MBTiles data by displaying a loading indicator.
  - Currently works offline

  OfflineMaps
  - Generated by Mobile Atlas Creator, uses Mbtiles SqLite as the format
  - Download Mobile Atlas Creator at https://mobac.sourceforge.io/quickstart/install.htm
  - Add google maps to Mobile Atlas Creator using https://gist.github.com/radum/2c3aa71c2ce94bbbbca8
  
  Limitations:
  - The MBTiles file must be accessed through the system file path (not from assets).
  - Currently, only `.txt` files with simple latitude,longitude formats are supported.
  - Currently, only displays one path of a 'gps'
  - Does not give directions to the landing site
  - Does not have a legend
  - Currently if the gps cordinates are outside the map there is a grey zone
